# notebooks/

Demonstration notebooks for LightStim protocols. Each notebook corresponds to a
protocol in `lightstim/protocols/` and shows:

1. A **protocol diagram** (small scale: d=3, 1-2 SE rounds)
2. Optionally, a **small numerical result** (hardcoded d=3/5, not a full sweep)

Sweep experiments belong in `benchmarks/`, not here.

### Memory/

Memory notebooks build through `MemoryExperiment` and the `lightstim` QECPatch API.
They show a small memory circuit and, optionally, a quick decoding example.

| Notebook | Code family |
|---|---|
| `memory_surface_family.ipynb` | Rotated SC, unrotated SC, toric code |
| `memory_defective_surface_code.ipynb` | Rotated SC with a mid-circuit data-qubit defect and alternating gauge checks |
| `memory_xzzx.ipynb` | Rotated XZZX surface code |
| `memory_HGP.ipynb` | HGP codes ([[13,1,3]], [[18,2,3]], [[225,9,4]]) |
| `memory_BB.ipynb` | Bivariate Bicycle codes ([[72,12,6]] … [[288,12,18]]) |
| `memory_color.ipynb` | Triangular color code (6-6-6) |
| `memory_bacon_shor.ipynb` | Weight-2 Bacon–Shor: dedicated four-layer SE, automatic detectors, CPU MWPM results |
| `memory_subsystem_surface.ipynb` | Planar subsystem surface code: dedicated X/Z gauge extraction, circuit diagram and a small CPU-MWPM example |
| `memory_PQRM.ipynb` | PQRM codes (1,2,4), (1,3,5), (1,4,6) |
| `memory_repetition.ipynb` | Repetition code (sanity check) |
| `memory_4D_hadamard.ipynb` | 4D geometric code (Hadamard-encoded) |
| `memory_H_six.ipynb` | Self-dual `[[6,2,2]]` H-code (Magic-H6 base code): generic-CSS coloration SE, `shortest_graphlike_error` fault distance |

The earlier subsystem prototype is kept locally in `archive/memory_subsystem.ipynb`.
A dedicated SHYPS memory notebook will accompany its later integration.
Generated experiment assets stay in playground, outside this directory.

### System/

| Notebook | Description |
|---|---|
| `qec_system_intro.ipynb` | QECSystem multi-patch API: define-by-run pattern, global index space |
| `define_by_run.ipynb` | Deep-dive into dynamic patch addition and coupler registration |

## Development workflow

See [`skills/notebook-workflow/SKILL.md`](../skills/notebook-workflow/SKILL.md) for the
full protocol development lifecycle: prototype → package → benchmark → demo.
